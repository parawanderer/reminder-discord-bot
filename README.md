# Reminder Discord Bot

I saw that I had this marked as private in my github account. I decided to make it public because I own the source code for this. Honestly it's not very interesting, but I wanted to make this public for transparency reasons. Especially as I can't share a lot of the work I did in 2018/2019 publicly due to not having it anymore and copyright/NDA reasons üôÅ.

This is a basic looping discord bot that I wrote in 2020 for a discord server, which would send reminders about a "Question of the Week" thing that was going on in the server.

The discord server is long gone, the account that owned the discord bot got banned for a silly reason and I don't use that platform anymore.
